A C# based local network chat server that utilizes asynchronous programming to register clients, queue incoming data, and broadcast messages to the group simultaneously.

Built using: TcpClient, TcpListener, NetworkStream, Sockets, Tasks (Async Threading), Dictionary, Queue, Interfaces, Text Logger, Dns, IPAddress

This project was a real turning point for me as I had previously never heard of many of the tools that were needed to build it, so finding and implementing them all proved to be quite a challenge. But through the process, I learned not just about new technologies, but more so about being a developer, and what personal traits are vital to becoming a successful one.
